[show Installation video (on iPad)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gnZtnvcJKyLXSIRJGKNTpa0OE24PblL0/view?usp=drivesdk)
1) Add a :bookmark: Bookmark "Goodreads Utility" to your browser
   - copy and paste this javascript code into the bookmark URL
      - by default this installation language is *Italian*
         > samoGoodreadsUtility={'lang':'ita'}
         
      - you can change language by replacing the 'lang' value **ita** with one of this [languages](https://asamorini.github.io/goodreads.utility/docs/languages.txt)
      
      ```
      javascript:var samoGoodreadsUtility={'lang':'ita'};(function(){var s=document.createElement('SCRIPT');s.type='text/javascript';s.src='https://asamorini.github.io/goodreads.utility/dist/goodreads.utility.min.js';document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(s);})();
      ```
2) and now, when you are visiting www.goodreads.com/ site
   - if you click the bookmark "Goodreads utility" a new menu will be shown
      ![new menu](docs/images/menu.01.added.png)
   - click on it to see utilities
      ![new menu opened](docs/images/menu.02.opened.png)
      
> Notes:
>   - after you have installed on your browser, you always use the last version, and receive automatically updates (so to become aware of new features, connected to this site)
>   - if you are synchronizing web browser bookmarks between your devices (example: pc and mobile phone and tablet), you need to install only on one browser
